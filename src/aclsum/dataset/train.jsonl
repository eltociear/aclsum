"introduction": ["In recent years , neural end-to-end dialogue response generation models ( Sordoni et al . , 2015 ; Serban et al . , 2016 ; Bordes et al . , 2016 ) has gained increasing popularity with the recent advancements of neural sequence-to-sequence ( seq2seq ) learning models ( Sutskever et al . , 2014 ; Vaswani et al . , 2017 ) .", "While neural dialogue models can generate seemingly fluent responses , due to the over-simplified maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) training objective and the high frequency of generic responses in training corpora , they tend to produce dull and generic responses such as \" I do n't know \" much more often than that humans generally do ( Li et al . , 2015 ) , which makes dialogue agents less engaging and ineffective .", "In addition , recent research on whether neural dialogue systems use dialogue history effectively ( Sankar et al . , 2019 ) shows that most neural dialogue agents fail to take the dialogue history into account when generating responses .", "This problem makes neural dialogue systems tend to generate responses irrelevant to the current topic of the conversation and are not consistent with the dialogue history .", "This problem may also intensify the generic response problem , as dull responses are generally off-topic and irrelevant to the dialogue history .", "To address the above issues , in this paper , we propose Inverse Adversarial Training ( IAT ) algorithm for training neural dialogue systems to avoid generic responses and model dialogue history better , thus generating diverse and informative responses .", "Conventional adversarial training methods generally generate label-preserving adversarial inputs with carefully designed methods and train the model to generate the same output to enhance the model 's robustness .", "In contrast , our approach perturbs in input dialogue history such that a good dialogue model should not generate the same output if the output is non-generic and relevant to the dialogue history .", "We name our proposed method as inverse adversarial training because it is related to conventional adversarial training methods which aim to improve the model 's adversarial robustness but our proposed objective is motivated in the opposite direction .", "Note that our work is not directly related to TextGANs as well as their applications on dialogue response generation .", "Specifically , the proposed inverse adversarial training assigns higher rewards to generated responses or ground-truth responses if their likeli-hood decreases more when the dialogue history is perturbed , and penalize the model when it generates responses whose likelihood is almost unchanged given either original or perturbed dialogue history as input .", "This encourages the model to generate more relevant and informative responses and capture dialogue history better .", "The proposed IAT algorithm can be used in both supervised and self-supervised fashion ( with / without reference response ) , which can be viewed as a form of reward-augmented maximum likelihood ( RAML ) method ( Norouzi et al . , 2016 ) that improves the original MLE objective or a rewarding scheme for RL-based text generation algorithms .", "The inverse adversarial learning framework is also conceptually related to self-adversarial learning ( Zhou et al . , 2020 ) where the the comparison is made between different checkpoints of the same model to provide reward for RL training of the NLG model .", "In addition , we identify a limitation of the widely-used maximum mutual information ( MMI ) based methods for improving the diversity of dialogue response generation models .", "This will be discussed in detail in section 2.1 and empirically demonstrated in section 4.2

dialogue systems model dialogue history better and generate more diverse and informative responses ."], "conclusion": ["In this work , we introduce inverse adversarial training ( IAT ) algorithm that is able to simultaneously reduce the dull response problem and help neural dialogue systems model dialogue history better .", "IAT measures the relevance and consistency of responses by the difference of their likelihood conditioning on either original and perturbed dialogue history .", "In this way , it is able to prevent the dialogue system from preferring generic responses , even they are often of high frequency in the training corpora .", "Our method also encourages the dialogue agent to model dialogue history better by penalizing the model when generating the same responses given perturbed dialogue history .", "Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that the proposed inverse adversarial training algorithm helps dialogue models capture dialogue history better and generate

"However , it is hard to train such an eligible ICD coder .", "Second , it is difficult to correctly assign proper codes to the input document even for professional coders , because one document can be assigned multiple ICD codes and the number of codes in the taxonomy of ICD is large .", "For example , there are over 15,000 and 60,000 codes respectively in the ninth version ( ICD-9 ) and the

, they ignore two important characteristics : Code Hierarchy and Code Co-occurrence , which can be leveraged to improve coding accuracy .", "In the following , we will introduce the two characteristics and the reasons why they are critical for the automatic ICD coding .", "Code Hierarchy : Based on ICD taxonomy , ICD codes are organized under a tree-like hierarchical structure as shown in Figure 2 , which indicates the parent-child and sibling relations between codes .", "In the hierarchical structure , the upper level nodes represent more generic disease categories and the lower level nodes represent more specific diseases .", "The code hierarchy can capture the mutual exclusion of some codes .", "If code X and Y are both children of Z ( i.e. , X and Y are the siblings

\" is assigned to a patient , it is unlikely to assign the code \" 464.01 ( acute laryngitis with obstruction ) \" to the patient at the same time .", "If automatic ICD coding models ignore such a characteristic , they are prone to giving inconsistent predictions .", "Thus , a challenging problem is how to model the code hierarchy and use it to capture the mutual exclusion of codes .", "Code Co-occurrence : Since some diseases are concurrent or have a causal relationship with each other , their codes usually co-occur in the clinical text , such as \" 997.91 ( hypertension ) \" and \" 429.9 ( heart disease ) \" .", "In this paper , we call such characteristic code co-occurrence which can capture the correlations of codes .", "The code co-occurrence can be utilized to correctly predict some codes which are difficult to predict by only using the clinical text itself .", "For example in Figure 1 , the code of \" acute respiratory failure \" can be easily inferred via capturing apparent clues ( i.e. , the green bold words ) from the text .", "Although there are also a few clues to infer the code of \" acidosis \" , they are very obscure , let alone predict the code of \" acidosis \" by only using these obscure clues .", "Fortunately , there is a strong association between these two diseases : one of the main causes of \" acidosis \" is \" acute respiratory failure \" .", "This prior knowledge can be captured via the fact that the codes of the two diseases usually co-occur in clinical texts .", "By considering the correlation , the automatic ICD coding model can better exploit obscure clues to predict the code of \" acidosis \" .", "Therefore , another problem is how to leverage code co-occurrence for ICD coding .", "In this paper , we propose a novel method termed as Hyperbolic and Co-graph Representation method ( HyperCore ) to address above problems .", "Since the tree-likeness properties of the hyperbolic space make it more suitable for representing symbolic data with hierarchical structures than the Euclidean space ( Nickel and Kiela , 2017 ) , we propose a hyperbolic representation learning method to learn the Code Hierarchy .", "Meanwhile ,

the word sequence does not matter ( Everaert et al . , 2015 )", "In all these cases , the number of the main verb \" thinks \" is determined by its subject ( \" girl \" ) , and this relation depends

friends \" ) , but this does not influence the structurally-determined form of the verb .", "When the cue and the target are adjacent ( \" the girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl girl thinks thinks thinks thinks thinks thinks thinks thinks thinks thinks thinks thinks thinks thinks thinks thinks thinks . . .", "\" ) , an LM can predict the target

there they occur with average 0.8 % sentence frequency ) .", "Moreover , they vary in the contexts that separate the cue and the target .", "So , RNNs are not simply memorizing frequent morphosyntactic sequences ( which would already be impressive , for systems learning from raw text ) .", "We tentatively conclude that LMtrained RNNs can construct abstract grammatical representations of their input .", "This , in turn , suggests that the input itself contains enough information to trigger some form of syntactic learning in a system , such as an RNN , that does not contain an explicit prior bias in favour of syntactic structures .", "In future work , we would like to better understand what kind of syntactic information RNNs are encoding , and how .", "On the one hand , we plan to adapt methods to inspect information flow across RNN states ( e.g. , Hupkes et al . , 2017 ) .", "On the other , we would like to expand our empirical investigation by focusing on other

such phenomena from corpora , their study would probe more sophisticated syntactic capabilities , possibly even shedding light on the theoretical analysis of the underlying linguistic structures .",
