gained a lot of popularity as a source of knowledge and information .", "These forums typically organize their content in the form of multiple topic-oriented question-comment threads , where a question posed by a user is followed by a list of other users ' comments , which intend to answer the question .", "Many of such on-line forums are not moderated , which often results in ( a ) noisy and ( b ) redundant content , as users tend to deviate from the question and start asking new questions or engage in conversations , fights , etc .", "Web forums try to solve problem ( a ) in various ways , most often by allowing users to up / downvote answers according to their perceived usefulness , which makes it easier to retrieve useful answers in the future .", "Unfortunately , this negatively penalizes recent comments , which might be the most relevant and updated ones .", "This is due to the time it takes for a comment to accumulate votes .", "Moreover , voting is prone to abuse by forum trolls ( Mihaylov et al . , 2015 ; Mihaylov and Nakov , 2016a ) .", "Problem ( b ) is harder to solve , as it requires that users verify that their question has not been asked before , possibly in a slightly different way .", "This search can be hard , especially for less experienced users as most sites only offer basic search , e.g. , a site search by Google .", "Yet , solving problem ( b ) automatically is important both for site owners , as they want to prevent question duplication as much as possible , and for users , as finding an answer to their questions without posting means immediate satisfaction of their information needs .", "In this paper , we address the general problem of finding good answers to a given new question ( referred to as original question ) in one such community-created forum .", "More specifically , we use a pairwise deep neural network to rank comments retrieved from different question-comment threads according to their relevance as answers to the original question being asked .", "A key feature of our approach is that we investigate the contribution of the edges in the triangle formed by the pairwise interactions between the original question , the related question , and the related comments to rank comments in a unified fashion .", "Additionally , we use three different sets of features that capture such similarity : lexical , distributed ( semantics / syntax ) , and domain-specific knowledge .", "The experimental results show that addressing the answer ranking task directly , i.e. , modelling only the similarity between the original question and the answer-candidate comments , yields very low results .", "The other two edges of the triangle are needed to obtain good results , i.e. , the similarity between the original question and the related question and the similarity between the related question and the related comments .", "Both aspects add significant and cumulative improvements to the overall performance .", "Finally , we show that the full network , including the three pairs of similarities , outperforms the state-of-the-art on a benchmark dataset .", "The rest of the paper is organized as follows : Section 2 discusses the similarity triangle in answer ranking for cQA , Section 3 presents our pairwise neural network model for answering new questions in community forums , which integrates multiple levels of interaction , Section 4 describes the features we used , Section 5 presents our evaluation setup , the experiments and the results , Section 6 discusses some related work , and Section 7 wraps up the paper with a brief summary of the contributions and some possible directions for future work .", "2 The Similarity Triangle in cQA Figure 1 presents an example illustrating the similarity triangle that we use when solving the answer ranking problem in cQA .", "In the figure , q stands for the new question , q is an existing related question , and c is a comment within the thread of question q .", "The edge qc relates to the main cQA task addressed in this paper , i.e. , deciding whether a comment for a potentially related question is a good answer to the original question .", "We will say that the relation captures the relevance of c for q.", "The edge qq represents the similarity between the original and the related questions .", "We will call this relation relatedness ."], "conclusion": ["We presented a neural-based approach to a novel problem in cQA , where given a new question , the task is to rank comments from related questionthreads

allowed us to study the impact and the interaction effects of the question-question relatedness and commentto-related question appropriateness relations when solving the primary cQA relevance task .", "The large performance gains obtained from using relatedness features show that question-question similarity plays a crucial role in finding relevant comments ( +30 MAP points ) .", "Yet , including

likelihood p \u03b8 ( x 1 : T ) , and then the discriminator is used to re-rank them .", "However , in addition that beam search can miss sequences with high likelihood , it is biased towards the likelihood , while the best sequence might only have an average likelihood , but satisfies the constraint perfectly .", "Hence , it might be more suitable to take the discriminator probability into account during decoding rather than after generating a whole sequence .", "In this case , the discriminator is used at each generation step t to get the probability p D ( c | x 1 : t ) for each token of the vocabulary V , and merge it to the likelihood p \u03b8 ( x 1 : t ) to choose which token to emit .", "In order to reduce the cost of using a discriminator on every possible continuation , GeDi

yield performance that is equivalent to the best approaches based on LM tuning at lower training cost .", "On the other hand , such approaches have an additional cost during inference because of the cost of the discriminator being applied to candidate generations .", "A study on this additional cost depending on the type of discriminator used can be found in ( Chaffin et al . , 2022 ) .", "PPL-MCTS offers a solution for cases where training is too costly for the downstream application or the language model is not directly accessible .", "Seeing text generation as a tree exploration process , an existing approach such as GeDi indeed lowers the cost of width exploration but the depth exploration is still an issue .", "Using GeDi for constrained generation is thus very similar to a standard maximum likelihood search which still lacks of an optimal search method .", "On the other hand , Monte Carlo Tree Search provides an efficient way to explore the tree by determining the best local choice in the long run , lowering the cost of depth exploration .", "Thus , these two methods solve different facets of constrained generation , and the combination of the two is a promising perspective .", "Moreover , MCTS allows to precisely define the best compromise between cost and quality through the number of iterations and the roll-out size , while ensuring the efficiency of the search theoretically .", "For reproducibility purposes , our implementation is made available at https : //github.com / NohTow / PPL-MCTS .", "Several research avenues are opened by this work .", "For methods yielding high perplexity , it would be interesting to explore how to set the \u03b1 parameter in order to reach the best compromise between accuracy and perplexity .", "Similarly , the size (

discriminator is above or below a threshold as in ( Cotarelo et al . , 2021 ) , would seem particularly suited for texts .", "It should also be noted that finetuning a model and controlling the generation with a discriminator can be used jointly .", "For instance , one can use PPL-MCTS on a tuned LM , which will most likely result in even better performances because sequences considered during the search will have an overall higher quality for the considered task .", "Finally , not only can PPL-MCTS be applied to any property that a discriminator can identify , but it can also work
